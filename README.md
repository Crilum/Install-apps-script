# Install-apps-script
Main purpose is for installing my favorite apps to RPiOS.

# Running the script

Really simple:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crilum/Install-apps-script/main/installapps| bash
```

Note: If anybody actually reads this, this script is broken. I don't really want to fix it right now, so it's probably not going to happen for a while, if ever.
