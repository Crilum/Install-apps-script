# Install-apps-script
Main purpose is for installing my favorite apps to RPiOS.

# Installing

Just clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Crilum/Install-apps-script`

Copy the script to `/bin/`:

`cd Install-apps-script && sudo cp installapps /bin/`

And then make it executable:

`sudo chmod +x /bin/installapps`

Finally, remove the cloned repo (if you want), and you're all done!

`cd ../ && rm Install-apps-script`

---

Try it out by typing `installapps` in your Terminal!
